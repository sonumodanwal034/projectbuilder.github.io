            <h3>To build an Android game, you can use several programming languages, including ..</h3>
            <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
            <p>1. Java: This is the most popular language used for developing Android games. 
                It is the primary programming language used in the Android Studio 
                Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
                which is Google's official IDE for Android development.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
            <p>2. Kotlin: Kotlin is a newer programming language 
                that is gaining popularity among Android developers.
                It is more concise and less verbose than Java and has 
                many modern language features, 
                such as null safety, lambdas, and coroutines.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
            <p>3. C++: C++ is a powerful programming language 
                that can be used to develop high-performance Android
                games. It is often used in game
                engines like Unreal Engine and Unity.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
            <h4>Once you have chosen a programming language, you can follow these steps to build an Android game:</h4>
            <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
                <h4>Step 1 : </h4>
            <p>Set up your development environment:
                Install Android Studio or another IDE of your 
                choice and set up an Android emulator or connect a 
                physical device for testing.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
                <h4>Step 2 : </h4>
            <p>Choose a game engine: 
                A game engine is a software framework 
                designed to make it easier to build games. 
                Some popular game engines for Android include Unity, 
                Unreal Engine, and Godot Engine.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
                <h4>Step 3 : </h4>
            <p>Create your game assets: This includes designing
                your game characters, backgrounds, and other game elements.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
                <h4>Step 4 : </h4>
            <p> Write your game code: Use your chosen 
                programming language to write the game logic, 
                including input handling, 
                game physics, and rendering.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
                <h4>Step 5 : </h4>
            <p>Test and debug: Test your game on the emulator or 
                device and debug any issues you encounter.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
                <h4>Step 6 : </h4>
            <p>Publish your game: When your game is ready, 
                publish it on the Google Play Store or 
                another app store of your choice.</p>
                <h1>--------------------------------------------------------------</h1>
            <p>Building an Android game is a complex process
                that requires skill and experience in game 
                development and programming. However, 
                with the right tools and resources, 
                anyone can learn how to build a successful Android game.</p>
